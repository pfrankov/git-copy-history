- Or any other local Git repository

## How it works

Example: your repo is not on GitHub so for others it looks like you've just stopped coding at all.

- This CLI takes all of YOUR commits from your local repo
- It commits only **hashes from hashes** for exact same timestamps to another repo
- This another repository has no private information inside but it has perfectly timed commit history
- It can be shared on GitHub without any restrictions
- You can even make the repository with history private - and commit history still will be visible (see the last section below)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g git-copy-history
```

## Usage

```bash
# Create new repo
mkdir just-history
cd just-history
git init

# Point git-copy-history to the source repo
# git-copy-history from <source> [options]
git-copy-history from ../local-repo
```

Create private [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new).
Follow the instructions for existing repositories.

- Add origin to your new repository
- Push the history to the remote repository

### Options

| Option      | Description |
|---          |---          |
| `--author`  | Option used to setup author name or author email. This option can be used multiple times.|
| `--secret`  | Option used to setup secret key to hashing algorithm that creates hashes of to repo hashes.<br /> **Every time must be the same.** |

## Update history

Just run `git-copy-history` again and it will add only the new commits.

```bash
git-copy-history from ../local-repo
git push
```

## Update your profile settings
